Markdown Syntax Sheet

Markdown reference sheet. All this time I was looking at it on alot of code sites, but didn't think that it was an actual language.
I'm glad I came across it. Another learning curve learned, and plenty more to go. Until next time. >quote the "adventure" (;-)

update:

Had to re-fix my code it wasn't correct.  I caught the errors earlier today, when I was writing functions. Beginners kink. Finalized realized that it wasn't correct, after re-writing functions all day long and working on my own beginners project. Added plus I'm starting to understand how to use git well enough to navigate back and forth through file changes and the working directories. Just notes for progress and productivity.
